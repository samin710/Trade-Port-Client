## 🧠 Overview

**TradePort** is a modern B2B e-commerce platform that allows authenticated users to add, browse, and manage products. Users can purchase items with quantity restrictions, see products in both card and table formats, and get notified about discounts via banner highlights. Product listings are categorized, and a dedicated "Available" section highlights bulk-purchasable products. While all users can edit products, deletion is limited to the original uploader. The cart system tracks purchases and dynamically adjusts stock when items are removed. The app also features a dark/light mode toggle for enhanced user experience.
